# Spreadsheet Application

Our goal is to implement a spreadsheet application. Spreadsheets are editable by nature. In our implementation we'll handle user inputs, and hiding and showing rows of data.

## Build the project

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path/to/Qt6> ..
$ cmake --build .
```

## Run

```
$ ./appspreadsheet
```
